Steps to create github page :
1. Create your repository
2. Make sure your repository is public
3. Go to pages section in settings
4. Set your branch to your main branch
5. Copy your custom domain
6. Open a browser and paste the ff "customdomain/repositoryname/"

Key takeaways :

This will be an important lesson which can help me work more efficiently and even allow collaborative html projects
